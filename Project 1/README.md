# Login Component for a SaaS Application

For this project, you're taking on an assignment working on a new login screen for the Buggsy bug tracking application.

You'll design and implement a responsive login component with fields for username and password, and a 'Login' button. And to make the login form functional, you'll also include form validation to ensure inputs are not empty.

## Instructions

Your task is to design and implement a responsive login component for the Buggsy bug tracking SaaS application. This component is not just a gateway for authentication but also an extension of the user's experience with the Buggsy brand. It should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and adaptable to any deviceâ€”desktop, tablet, or mobile.

You may use any tools you wish in order to build the frontend.

Our focus in this application is to practice responsive design and basic form validation. We have provided a JSON file with sample user credentials that you can use to validate against, but this isn't explicitly required to solve the project.

## Objectives

- **Build a Frontend Login Page**: Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and responsive login page.
- **Implement Form Validation**: Ensure the login form validates user input for the username and password fields, providing immediate and clear feedback for any validation errors.

## User Stories

1. Secure Access: As a user, I want to enter my credentials to securely access the bug tracking application.
2. Feedback on Authentication: As a user, I want immediate feedback if my login details are blank or incorrect, enabling me to correct any mistakes without confusion.
3. Responsive Design: As a user, I expect the login page to be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on my device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Form Validation Feedback: Implement immediate visual feedback for form validation errors using subtle animations or color changes.
- Error Message Guidance: On login failure, display a non-compromising error message that guides users on their next steps.
- Successful Login Redirection: Redirect users to the dashboard page upon successful authentication.

## Skills Practiced

- **Frontend Development**: Deepen your expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design and accessibility.
- **UX/UI Design**: Develop a keen eye for user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interfaces, including effective user feedback mechanisms. And refine your ability to build a pixel-perfect frontend from a given design spec and mockup.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, documenting your development process and changes.

## Stretch Goals

To go above and beyond, consider adding one or more of the following features:

- **Credential Validation**: Match user input against the provided sample user credentials.
- **Remember Me**: Implement a secure "remember me" feature to keep users logged in.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Improve usability by allowing users to toggle password visibility.
- **OAuth Integration**: Facilitate login via external services like GitHub or Google.

## Starter Materials

To help you get started, you're equipped with the following assets:

- Project Images: Necessary image files, including logos, are provided.
- Style Guide: Direct from Buggsy, featuring color schemes, fonts, and more.
- Preview Images: Visual benchmarks to guide your design to completion.
- Figma File: Leverage design files in Figma as a blueprint for your development efforts.

## Submitting Your Solution

Once you're satisfied with your solution, go to the project hub and hit the "Submit solution" button. You'll be asked to fill out a few fields and reflect on your experience with the project.

Here's a quick guide to submitting your solution:

1. **Commit your code to GitHub**: Create a public repository for your project.

2. **Deploy your app**: Consider services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish your solution.

3. **Submit via the Curricular project hub**: Access the project hub, click on "Submit solution," and complete the submission form, reflecting on your project experience.

## Getting Help

Our goal with Curricular projects is to align the experience with the realities of professional software development work. Even seasoned developers encounter obstacles, so our aim is to equip you with the skills to navigate challenges independently.

As a result, our approach to support encourages self-reliance and initiative, and we generally don't answer questions or provide guidance if you get stuck.

### When to Seek Help

While direct assistance is limited, we recognize there are situations where guidance is necessary. You are encouraged to contact support@curricular.dev for support under the following conditions:

1. You've exhaustively explored solutions to overcome a hurdle but remain stuck. We value the effort to resolve issues independently, reflecting real-world scenarios where immediate answers aren't always available.
2. You encounter errors or missing elements within the provided project materials that hinder progress.

For all other challenges, we encourage you to leverage external resources, just like you would in a professional setting.

### Consulting External Resources

The internet is full of great information. It's also full of poor advice, outdated solutions, and hacks. As a professional developer, you'll need to get good at sifting through the bad.

Utilize official documentation, Stack Overflow, and developer forums extensively. These resources are invaluable for understanding technologies and solving coding problems.

Often, others have faced similar challenges; finding tutorials and articles related to your problem can offer solutions and best practices. But tread carefully here, as you can also unlearn some best practices here as well.

### Asking Clarifying Questions and Making Assumptions

A key developer skill is to identify when and how to seek clarification on ambiguous requirements or design elements. We encourage the following approach:

- **Document Assumptions**: If specific details are unclear, make reasonable assumptions based on your understanding of the project's goals and document these assumptions in your solution submission. This practice is common in professional environments and demonstrates proactive problem-solving.

- **Inquiry for Clarification**: For critical ambiguities that significantly impact project direction or user experience, email support@curricular.dev with your questions. Include a brief description of your understanding, the assumption you're inclined to make, and why you believe clarification is necessary. We will respond as promptly as possible.


## Good Luck and Happy Coding!
